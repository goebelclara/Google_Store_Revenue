# Google_Store_revenue
Exploring and predicting Google Store visitor revenue

## Project description:
The following analysis seeks to generate deeper insights on the Google Store's visitor base between mid 2017 and mid 2018, determine which underlying variables drive visitor conversion, and provide reliable statistical models to classify which users generate revenue and to estimate how much revenue they generate.
    
The dataset used in this report stems from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data) hosted by RStudio and Google Cloud (RStudio and Google Cloud, 2019). It contains data on Google Store sessions at a given time by a given visitor. For each visitor session, the date and time, the visitor's demographics (e.g. country), device-related data (e.g. operating system), traffic-related data (e.g. influx channel), behavior during the session (e.g. time spent on site), and the visitor's transaction revenue (if any) are recorded. The data was gathered between mid 2017 and mid 2018. Given computational constraints, the dataset was downsampled from 25GB to 1GB by taking a random selection of the rows.
